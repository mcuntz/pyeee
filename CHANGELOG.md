# Changelog

All notable changes after its initial development up to January 2020 (v0.2) are documented in this file.

### v1.2
    - Sample not only from uniform distribution but allow all
      distributions of scipy.stats in morris_sampling, screening/eee, and
      eee/see.

### v1.1
    - Make number of final trajectories an argument instead of a
      keyword argument in screening/ee.
    - Make number of final trajectories an argument instead of a
      keyword argument and sample by default 10*final trajectories in
      Morris Method, i.e. morris_sampling.

### v1.0
    - Restructured package with functions and utils subpackages.

### v0.9
    - Added mention to template of Sebastian Mueller in README.md and documentation.
    - Renamed morris.py to morris_method.py.
    - Adjusted names of arguments and keyword arguments in
      morris_sampling and elementary_effects to be consistent with
      rest of pyeee.

### v0.8
    - Split tests in individual files, one per module.
    - Changed from ValueError to TypeError if function given to exe wrappers.
    - InputError does not exist, use TypeError in screening.
    - Use assertRaises for check error handling in tests.
    - Plot diagnostic figures in png files in Morris sampling if
      matplotlib installed.
    - Coverage at maximum except for eee.py.

### v0.7
    - Make systematically function_p versions of all logistic
      functions and its derivatives.
    - Keep formatting of names and spaces with sub_names_params
      functions.
    - Close input file before raising error in
      standard_parameter_reader_bounds_mask.
    - Removed missing coverage in function_wrappers, std_io,
      sa_test_functions, and general_functions.

### v0.6
    - Tests did not work on TravisCI because pyeee not installed: put
      pyeee in PYTHONPATH for tests and in shell script.
    - Added tests for standard IO and documented missing coverage.

### v0.5
    - Added tests for general functions, function and exe wrappers,
      Morris Elementary Effects, SA test functions, screening, and tee
      to increase coverage.
    - Renamed ntsteps to nsteps in eee to be consistent with screening/ee.
    - Change check of logfile in eee: check for string rather than
      file handle to be independent of Python version.
    - Replaced kwarg.pop mechanism in exe wrappers because it removed
      the keywords from subsequent function calls.

### v0.4.2
    - Second release online on Github, simply to trigger zenodo.

### v0.4.1
    - First release on zenodo.

### v0.4
    - Replaced numpy.matrix arithmetic with numpy.dot on ndarray in.
      Morris sampling: no numpy deprecation warnings anymore.

### v0.3
    - Added test for see, using logfile and several processes in eee.
    - Added seed keyword to screening/ee.
    - Distinguish iterable and array_like parameter types in all routines.
    - Added verbose keyword to eee / see.
    - Added Elementary Effects (ee) in README.md and Quick usage guide.
    - Corrected error in description of pyeee in setup.py, and set development status to 4 - Beta.

### v0.2
    - Initial release on PyPI.
